- **Improved understanding of snow melt and accumulation process in the HMA region**

Snow covers a large area of Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH) region. In the HKH region, the seasonal snow is a central component of the cryosphere and a primary source of freshwater for over one billion people. Obtaining accurate snow information is vital for monitoring, modeling, and evaluating snow-related hazards in the Himalayas. The dynamics of snow cover remain poorly understood. By combining remote sensing data (MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel) with field observations and empirical and physical snow models (SeNorge, FSM2, J2000), I hope to enhance our understanding of snow processes in the HKH region.
