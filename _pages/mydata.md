Data collection, preprocessing, and analysis are integral parts of almost all scientific research. With data, we can see patterns, make spatial and statistical analyses, and predict future conditions. Observations of the cryosphere can be conducted via field observations, models, or satellite imagery.

I have been involved in field-based cryosphere data collection, such as glacier mass balance, snow measurement, and river discharge, etc. The data can be retrieved for free from the ICIMOD RDS system.

Furthermore, I contributed to generating improved snow cover products from MODIS data. This data can be freely downloaded from [this link](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.901821).
