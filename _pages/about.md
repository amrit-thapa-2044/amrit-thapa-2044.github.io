I am PhD student at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](https://www.uaf.edu/uaf/). Using microwave and optical remote sensing products along with field observations, I'm trying to gain a better understanding of cryosphere dynamics over the Hindu Kush Himalayas. 

Previously, I worked at [ICIMOD](https://www.icimod.org/) as a reserach analyst and research associate for six years and four months. During my formal involvement with ICIMOD,I was responsible for assessing cryosphere change in the HKH region. This includes field-based measurements of snow, permafrost, glacier mass balance, river runoff and other hydro-meteorological variables.I also analyzed freely available satellite data to assess snow cover dynamics on a larger scale and run glacio-hydrological models in the Himalayan catchment to better understand water sources and storage. I supported permafrost mapping and modelling activities and contributed as a resource person in cryosphere related training.

I hold an MSc in Environmental Sciences from [Jawaharlal Nehru University](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/), India (2012 to 2014) and an MS by Research in Glaciology from [Kathmandu University](https://ku.edu.np/), Nepal (2014-2016).
