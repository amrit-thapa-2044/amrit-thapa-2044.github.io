As a PhD student at the [University of Alaska Fairbanks](https://www.uaf.edu/uaf/), I aim to deepen my understanding of permafrost dynamics in the Hindu Kush Himalayas through the use of microwave and optical remote sensing products and field observations. My prior work experience includes a 6-year and 4-month tenure as a research analyst and associate at  [ICIMOD](https://www.icimod.org/), where I assessed changes in the cryosphere in the HKH region. My responsibilities included conducting field measurements of snow, permafrost, glacier mass balance, river runoff, and other hydro-meteorological variables, analyzing satellite data to study snow cover dynamics, running glacio-hydrological models in the Himalayan catchment to understand water sources and storage, and participating in permafrost mapping and modeling activities as a resource person in cryosphere-related training. I hold two degrees in the sciences, including an MSc in Environmental sciences from [Jawaharlal Nehru University](https://www.jnu.ac.in/main/) and an MS by Research in Glaciology from [Kathmandu University](https://ku.edu.np/), Nepal.
