I am a post-doctoral scholar at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, CA, working with [Professor Mark Simons](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~simons/), and a member of the algorithm development team for the Observational Products for End-users from Remote sensing Analysis ([OPERA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera)) project of NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

My research interests include algorithm and tools development for the time series analysis of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Interferometric SAR (InSAR) and solid earth processes associated with active volcanism and tectonics and their related geological hazards. My long-term research objective is to improve the understanding of the surface response caused by the tectonic and non-tectonic processes deforming the solid earth.
