I am a postdoctoral scholar research associate at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California, working with [Professor Mark Simons](http://web.gps.caltech.edu/~simons/), and a member of the algorithm development team for the Observational Products for End-users from Remote sensing Analysis ([OPERA](https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/go/opera)) project of NASAâ€™s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

My long-term research objective is to better understand the surface response caused by tectonic, volcanic, and anthropogenic processes deforming the solid Earth and other planets. I am most interested in developing geodetic techniques to precisely measure the ground surface deformation to understand how and when it deforms with the present of geohazards. To this end, I am interested in the following research topics:

+ SAR / InSAR Algorithm and Tools Development
+ Geohazards from Active Volcanism and Tectonics
+ High Resolution InSAR Monitoring: Landslides and Infrastructures
