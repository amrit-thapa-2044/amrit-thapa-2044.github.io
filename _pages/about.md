[I](https://www.icimod.org/team/amrit-thapa/) am working as a RS & Geoinformation Research Analyst-Cryosphere Research at the [International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development-ICIMOD](https://www.icimod.org/).I hold an MSc in Environmental Sciences from Jawaharlal Nehru University, India and an MS by Research in Glaciology from Kathmandu University, Nepal

I am responsible for assessing cryosphere change in the HKH region. This includes field-based measurements of cryospheric components like glacier, snow, permafrost, glacier mass balance, river runoff and other hydro-meteorological variables. I also analyze freely available satellite data to assess snow cover dynamics on a larger scale and run glacio-hydrological models in the Himalayan catchment to better understand water sources and storage. I support permafrost mapping and modelling activities and contributed as a resource person in cryosphere related training.
